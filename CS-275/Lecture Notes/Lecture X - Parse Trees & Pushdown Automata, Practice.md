#### Parse Trees: 
- Definition:
	- A parse tree for a context-free grammar is a tree labelled by terminals, non-terminals and ε subject to the following rules: 
		- Root is labelled S
		- A vertext is a leaf iff it is labelled by a terminal or ε
		- For every non-leaf V there is a rule with the label v on the left, and the concatenation of the child labels on the right
		- ε appears as only child
- Theorem:
	- The language generated by a context-free grammar consists exactly of the words built from the terminals on the leaves of finite parse trees, in order.

#### Parse Trees, An Example :
- Grammar:
	- S -> 0
	- S -> 1
	- S -> 2
	- S -> (S + S)
	- S -> (S X S)
- The Word: 
	- ((0+1) x (2 x (1+0)))
- The Tree:

#### Constructing a Parse Tree: 
- Consider the context-free grammar:
	- S -> ST
	- S -> ε
	- T -> a
	- T -> Ub
	- U -> Ub
	- U -> ε

#### From Context-Free Grammar to Pushdown Automaton:
- Question: Construct a pushdown automaton for the language described by the grammar:
	- S -> aSbS
	- S -> bSaS
	- S -> ε
